# Metasploit Framework — Task 1  
## Introduction to Metasploit  
**TryHackMe Room Notes**

---

## 📌 What is Metasploit?

Metasploit is the **most widely used exploitation framework** in cybersecurity.

It supports **all phases of penetration testing**, including:
- Information gathering
- Scanning
- Exploitation
- Payload delivery
- Post-exploitation
- Vulnerability research
- Exploit development

It is used in:
- Penetration testing
- Red teaming
- Vulnerability assessment
- Security research
- Exploit development labs

---

# 🧱 Metasploit Versions

## 1) Metasploit Pro
- Commercial version
- GUI-based
- Automation features
- Management dashboards
- Reporting tools
- Team collaboration features

## 2) Metasploit Framework (MSF)
- Open-source version
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Installed on:
  - AttackBox
  - Kali Linux
  - Parrot OS
  - Most pentesting distros
- This room focuses on **Metasploit Framework**

---

# 🧠 What is Metasploit Framework?

Metasploit Framework is a **collection of tools** that allow:

- Information gathering  
- Scanning  
- Exploitation  
- Exploit development  
- Post-exploitation  
- Payload handling  
- Session management  

It is modular and extensible.

---

# 🧩 Core Components

## 1) msfconsole
**Main interface**
- Command-line environment
- Central control panel
- Used for:
  - Searching exploits
  - Loading modules
  - Setting options
  - Running attacks
  - Managing sessions

```bash
msfconsole
````

---

## 2) Modules

Modules are the building blocks of Metasploit.

### Types of modules:

* **Exploits** → actual vulnerabilities
* **Payloads** → what runs on target
* **Scanners** → discovery tools
* **Auxiliary** → support modules (bruteforce, fuzzing, enum)
* **Post** → post-exploitation actions
* **Encoders** → payload obfuscation
* **Nops** → padding for exploit dev

---

## 3) Tools

Standalone tools included in Metasploit:

### Examples:

* `msfvenom` → payload generator
* `pattern_create` → exploit dev tool
* `pattern_offset` → exploit dev tool

> Only **msfvenom** is covered in this room
> Others are for advanced exploit development

---
