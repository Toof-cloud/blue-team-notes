Networking Fundamentals

Networking - Things that are connected, a network is formed from 2 - endless devices or persons. 

WWW - World Wide Web, Tim Berners-Lee 1989

LAN (Local Area Network) - a group of connected computing devices within a localized are

LAN Topologies 
- Star - individually connected to a switch
- Bus - single connection(backbone cable) and all data travels along the same cable
- Ring - data runs along the loop until the data has reached is target destination 

Switch - Dedicated devices within a network that are designed to aggregate multiple other devices such as computers, printer, or any network-capable devices. 

Router - connects networks and pass data between them, using routing.

Subnetting - Splitting up the networks to smaller network within itself. 32 bits in a subnet mask.

ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) - is responsible for allowing devices to identify themselves on a network

DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) - assigns automatically of a device their IP Address.

OSI Model (Open System Interconnection Model)
- This model provides a framework dictating how all networked devices will send, receive, and interpret data.

1. Physical - Physical components of the hardwares used in networking
2. Datalink - Focuses on the physical addressing of the transmission. Inside every networked device is a NIC(Network Interface Card) which comes with their MAC to identify it.
