Reflection:
1. Ai does not really hack into systemsm, it is used to automate repetetive tasks by a hacker like sending a lot of fake emails and learning from those who attract people more and refining it to be better, they can also be used to scan websites and applications for vulnerabilities making decision making easier.
2. Ai helps in defending systems and websites as they are automated, continously running, and detecting anomalies from logs, packets, impossible time frame travels. It also makes analysts life easier as it can help with detections and monitoring.
3. Deepfakes from videos to voices, Ai can recreate voice emails and social engineering tactics to gain the trust of the victims and password reusing of hacked/breached emails and accounts.
4. ALWAYS BE SLOW TO ACT AND THINK FIRST BEFORE CLICKING ANY LINK OR BUTTONS, social engineering works because of user failures and gets our trust, dont trust any link, verify first and NEVER LOGIN AND 2FA your account, always ask fist and double think.
5. When connected to their wifi your credentials will be seen and they can intercept and redirect you to fake login pages without you knowing. Always be careful in connecting to public wifi's.
6. AI cannot be transgender because it has no body, biological sex, or personal identity.
Transgender identity refers to a human experience involving gender and self-awareness, which AI does not possess.
When AI appears gendered, it is simply a design or language choice, not an identity.
